How does this tool work?

This tool works by exploiting the zero day blind SQL injection vulnerability in the Garena topup system and exploiting it to get the topup ID that you have done by launching a bruteforce attack.
Then this tool will create a fake topup transaction with a valid topup ID that you have done.

Therefore, make sure you have topped up at least once to run this tool.
Don't try it if you've never done a top up because it could potentially make your account permanently banned because it was detected as a hacking attempt!
